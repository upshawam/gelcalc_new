# DIY Fueling Calculator – Ingredient Rationale

This calculator provides recipes for DIY gels based on popular commercial products, using evidence‑based fueling principles for endurance activities.  
Select a gel type and number of gels to get the ingredient list.

## ⚡ Carbohydrates
The calculator supports different carbohydrate ratios based on the selected gel:

- **gelcalc_v1 & Precision Fuel PF30: 2:1 glucose:fructose** (30g carbs/gel)  
  Fast‑absorbing glucose source (maltodextrin) paired with fructose for optimal absorption.

- **Maurten GEL 100: 0.8:1 fructose:glucose** (25g carbs/gel)  
  Uses glucose syrup (similar to maltodextrin) and fructose.

- **SIS Beta Fuel: 1:0.8 maltodextrin:fructose** (40g carbs/gel)  
  Balanced ratio for sustained energy.

## 🍋 Citric Acid
- Added in a very small amount (0.4% of carbs) for tartness and palatability.  
- Helps balance acidity so the gel tastes better over long hours.

## 🧂 Sodium (Table Salt)
- Critical for replacing sodium lost in sweat, maintaining fluid balance, and supporting muscle function.  
- The calculator targets **~300 mg sodium per 30 g carbs**, a common endurance guideline.  
- Sodium scales with total carbs, providing appropriate amounts for the batch.

### Why this setup?
- **Efficient absorption**: Optimized carb ratios based on commercial gels for high absorption rates without GI issues.  
- **Balanced electrolytes**: Sodium tied to carb load, keeping hydration and fueling aligned.  
- **Palatable**: Citric acid improves taste without overwhelming the stomach.  
- **Cost‑effective**: DIY gels replicate commercial products at a fraction of the price.
